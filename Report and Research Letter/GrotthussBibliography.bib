abstract = "This review article is divided into three sections. In Section 1, a short biographical note on Freiherr von Grotthuss is followed by a detailed summary of the main findings and ideas present in his 1806 paper. Attempts to place Grotthuss contribution in the context of the science done at his time were also made. In Section 2, the modern version of the Grotthuss mechanism is reviewed. The classical Grotthuss model has been recently questioned and new mechanisms and ideas regarding proton transfer are briefly discussed. The last section discusses the significance of a classical Grotthuss mechanism for proton transfer in water chains inside protein cavities. This has been an interesting new twist in the ongoing history of the Grotthuss mechanism. A summary and discussion of what was learned from probably the simplest currently available experimental models of proton transfer in water wires in semi-synthetic ion channels are critically presented. This review ends discussing some of the questions that need to be addressed in the near future."

abstract="We explain how Feynman's path-integral formulation of quantum statistical mechanics gives a natural way of simulating quantum systems in thermal equilibrium. The theory is first outlined for a simple system, consisting of a single particle in one dimension acted on by an external potential. Starting from the standard basic expressions for the partition function and the thermal averages of observables, it is shown how a simple sequence of mathematical operations allows these expressions to be brought into Feynman's path-integral form. In this form, the quantities of interest are expressed as an integral over cyclic paths of the particle, which can be evaluated by classical simulation methods. This approach, generalized to many particles in three dimensions, gives a simulation technique for quantum many-body systems. We discuss how to calculate some important observables such as the energy and the radial distribution function. In the application of path-integral techniques to systems like liquid helium, the inclusion of quantum exchange is crucial, and we indicate how this can be achieved. We then illustrate the use of the technique by describing simulations that have been performed on (i) an electron dissolved in a molten salt; (ii) hydrogen in metals; and (iii) liquid helium-four.",

transferable to other structures and provide the means for performing
computationally demanding calculations of fairly large systems. These
calculations, including molecular dynamics, are of comparable accuracy to
first-principles calculations and three orders of magnitude faster.}

Molecular constants were obtained by the least-squares fitting of the observed frequencies, and band origins of the and subbands were determined to be 3389.656(2) and 3491.170(2) cm−1, respectively. During this study, assignment of the ν3 fundamental band was extended to higher J, K transitions, which do not fit to the calculated pattern well, but have definitely been assigned by using the ground state combination differences and relative intensities. Vibration–rotation interactions between the ν1 and ν3 states have been considered, which explained some large discrepancies between observed and calculated frequencies and led to the identification of forbidden transitions. Energy differences in the ground state between the ΔK = 3 rotational levels were obtained from the combination differences of the forbidden and allowed transitions, which led to an accurate determination of C and DK. Equilibrium structure of H3O+ has been derived to be re = 0.974(1) Å and αe = 113.6(1)°."

	abstract = {The authors present a tight-binding model of cohesion and interatomic forces which exploits the variational principle of density functional theory. The binding energy of a solid is expressed as a sum of four terms, each of which has a clear physical meaning. The first two terms are the covalent bond and promotion energies, which are found by solving the electronic Hamiltonian to obtain the density matrix. The remaining two terms describe changes in the total electrostatic and exchange-correlation energies on forming the solid from isolated atoms. The variational principle allows these two terms to be expressed as functionals of a superposition of frozen atomic charge densities. The authors show that they may then be approximated by a sum of pair potentials. The importance of self-consistency in tight-binding models is discussed with particular attention to the evaluation of the bulk modulus and certain interatomic force constants by frozen-phonon calculations. It is shown that serious errors may arise in non-self-consistent models due to the violation of charge conservation and the neglect of variations in the potential caused by charge flow. The authors advocate local charge neutrality as the simplest approximation to self-consistency which overcomes these problems. This assumption leads to a remarkably simple expression for the force on an atom due to its neighbours, which is both physically transparent and computationally efficient. These concepts are illustrated for three-dimensional solids by calculations of covalent bond energies in BCC, FCC and HCP transition metals using a canonical d-band model. Model one-dimensional calculations are also presented which illustrate the computation of covalent bond energies and interatomic forces at surfaces and interfaces, and the importance of local charge neutrality in the model.}

    abstract = { It is pointed out that one of the main effects of correlation phenomena in d- and f-bands is to give rise to behaviour characteristic of the atomic or Heitler-London model. To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined. }

abstract  ="We address the broader conceptual and pedagogical implications of recent recommendations of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) concerning the re-definition of hydrogen bonding{,} drawing upon the recommended IUPAC statistical methodology of mutually correlated experimental and theoretical descriptors to operationally address the title question. Both direct and statistical lines of evidence point to the essential resonance covalency of H-bonding interactions{,} rather than the statistically insignificant “dipole–dipole” character that is persistently advocated in current textbooks. The revised conception of H-bonding is both supported by modern quantum chemical technology and consistent with the pre-quantal insights of G. N. Lewis and other bonding pioneers. We offer specific suggestions for how relatively minor changes in the usual discussion of Lewis-structural and resonance concepts—supported by modern web-based computational modeling tools—can readily accommodate this fundamental change of perspective."}

    abstract = "{Ab initio simulations on Grotthuss mechanism have been carried out. Using the simulation results together with the existing experimental data, all the popular propositions for Grotthuss mechanism, including the one recently proposed by Noam [1], have been checked. Combining with the charge distribution calculation and the movement of the positive charge center inside the protonated water cluster during the proton diffusion process, only one mechanism is shown probable, while all the other proposed mechanisms are excluded. According to this probable mechanism, the high mobility of proton inside water is caused by the high diffusion rate of H5O2+, while the diffusion of H5O2+ is mainly induced by the thermal movement of water molecules at the second solvation shell of H5O2+ cation and the Zundel polarization inside the cation ion. Furthermore, the external field and thermo-dynamic effects play important roles during the transport process by affecting the reorientation of water molecules at the neighborhood of the second solvation shell of H5O2+ to induce the Zundel polarization and by providing the energy for the cleavage of the hydrogen bond between a newly formed water molecule and H5O2+. Because the weight (fraction) of H5O2+ among protonated water clusters decreases as temperature increases, this proposed mechanism is considered to play the dominant role only when temperature is below 572 K, above which, protons transport by other mechanisms become dominant.}",
