This folder contains a picture of the atoms in the cell and three videos (these are .mov files so are easiest to watch in quicktime player on a mac). 

- GrotthussDoubleJump.mov shows two consecutive grotthuss jumps, where a proton jumps from a hydronium ion to a water molecule and then to another water molecule.

- FlickeringEvent.mov shows a proton jumping repeatedly between two molecules in a flickering event.

- GrotthussBreakdown.mov shows a proton breaking away from the hydronium ion in a way that is not observed in real water. Our simulations are not valid once this has taken place.
