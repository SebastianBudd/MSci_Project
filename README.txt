This folder contains all the files that I have used and created throughout my project, including python scripts for creating various configurations of atoms, files to run empirical tight binding, results and pictures and videos of simulations

- The most important folder is 126 water molecule + h3o + oh, which contains all the results of the molecular dynamics simulations that I performed on a cubic cell containing 126 water molecules, 1 hydronium ion and 1 hydroxide ion. It contains all the relevant tbe files and python scripts as well as videos of the md simulations.

- 126 water molecules + h3o + Ab contains files relevant to simulations performed using a cubic cell containing 126 water molecules, 1 hydronium ion and 1 Ab atom that we created and simulations performed using a cubic cell containing 126 water molecules, 1 hydronium ion and 1 Cl atom.

- 64 h2o long cuboid contains files relevant to simulations performed using a long cuboid cell containing 62 water molecules, 1 hydronium ion and 1 Ab atom that we created.

- Water ring contains files relevant to simulations performed using ring of 15 water molecules and one hydronium ion.

- Python scripts contains most of the python scripts that I wrote throughout the project. Many of these are also included in the folders for the relevant simulations.

- Report and Research Letter contains a copy of my report and research letter as well as copies of all figures.
